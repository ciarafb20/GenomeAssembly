# Downloaded my assigned genome from the link provided. The files are in a 
folder called genomeassembly on my desktop. 

# Activated my environment with: conda activate genomeanalysis

# Ran the following two commands: pwd and cd (dragged my genomeassembly 
folder into terminal) 

# Ran SPAdes v4.1.0 with the following code: spades.py -1 Ciara_1.fastq.gz 
-2 Ciara_2.fastq.gz -o spadesout

# Ran ABySS v2.3.7 with the following code: abyss-pe name=assembly k=96 
B=2G in=‘Ciara_1.fastq.gz Ciara_2.fastq.gz’

# Looked at abyss results with ls command.

# Decluttered abyss results with the following command: mkdir abyssout
mv assembly* abyssout/

# Noted that we are interested in the assembly-scaffolds.fa and 
assembly-stats.csv files.

# Checked the quality of spades assembly using QUAST v5.3.0 with the 
following code: quast.py spadesout/scaffolds.fasta -o quastspades

# Checked the quality of abyss assembly using QUAST with the following 
code: quast.py abyssout/assembly-scaffolds.fa -o quastabyss

# Looked at both QUAST files and determined that the spades assembly was 
the best fit. Screenshots of both quast reports were included in a 
separate document. 

# Ran barrnap v0.9 using the following code to pull rRNA sequences: 
barrnap --kingdom bac spadesout/scaffolds.fasta > rRNAsequences.gff

# Used bedtools v2.31.1 to pull fasta sequences using the following code: 
bedtools getfasta -fi spadesout/scaffolds.fasta -bed rRNAsequences.gff -fo 
rRNAsequences.fasta

# Decluttered barrnap and bedtools results with the following command: 
mkdir rRNAinfo
mv rRNAs* rRNAinfo/

# Used blastn to identify 16S rRNA sequence.
Closest match: Vibrio cholerae

# Ran DFAST v1.3.6 for protein annotation with the following code: dfast 
--genome spadesout/scaffolds.fasta --out dfast_output

# Protein annotation with RAST. Domain Bacteria, Genus Vibrio, species 
cholerae, Genetics Code 11, RAST Annotation RASTtk

# Average nucleotide identity with fastANI v1.34 with the following code: 
neighbors/vulnificus.fasta
neighbors/harveyi.fasta


fastANI -q spadesout/scaffolds.fasta --rl neighbors.txt -o 
vibrioneighbors.txt
